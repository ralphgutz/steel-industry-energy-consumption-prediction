# Steel Industry Energy Consumption Prediction

This analysis seeks to identify the variables that highly affect the industry energy consumption of DAEWOO Steel Co. Ltd in Gwangyang, South Korea and to fit a linear model that minimizes errors to predict the energy consumption using the given data set. It is identified that tco2 or the measure of carbon dioxide is highly correlated to industry energy consumption (usage) at 0.99 correlation coefficient. Next is the lagging current reactive power at 0.90. The final model produced has an adjusted R-squared of 0.859 with standard error < 0.179.
